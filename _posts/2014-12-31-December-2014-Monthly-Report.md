As 2014 draws to a close, it is a time for reflection on what I have accomplished since I started at UNL and where I would  like to see things go in 2015.  
While I am still mentally processing the experiences, my research did not go exactly as I envisioned because I had to navigate a million new things. 
This is also confirmed by the reduction in the number of journal papers I read. 
According to my log, I used to read 17 articles per month on average in both 2012 and 2013, whereas the number drastically dropped to 7 in 2014. 
This obviously suggests that I have spent a large amount of my time on non-research activities. 
I have to move all ongoing  work to my second semester To-Do list. 
I wish to allocate more time on reading papers, preparing for teaching materials, and conducting research. 
That being said, I am proud to mention that at least I was able to get this [review article](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fgene.2014.00363/abstract) published during my turbulent first semester. 

Regarding professional development accomplishments, 
I have successfully completed 2014 Just in Time Teaching (JiTT) workshop in which we met biweekly on Wednesdays between 11:30am and 1pm in the Brace Hall. 
This teaching workshop  made me aware of a lot of resources available to implement active learning. 

On a personal note, my H-1B visa application has been approved by USCIS. 
This process was a no-brainer for me because my department took care of everything. All I had to do was to provide documents they requested. 
Over the last two weeks of December I was visiting Japan to obtain an H-1B visa sticker at the US Embassy in Tokyo. 
This trip gave me leeway to relax and allow myself to decompress after the end of busy 2014 period. 
I worked over the Pacific Ocean until before Christmas day to ease my load in the coming year and then took some time away from the desk to catch up with my friends and family.
