As of March 2015, I am halfway through my first year at UNL.
This month opened with a trip to Iowa State University in Ames.
I gave an invited seminar entitled "Quantitative Genetics in the Functional Genomics era" covering topics ranging from functional characterization of whole-genome regression to MeSH enrichment analysis.
The main thrust of my talk was to highlight that this is opportune time to conduct quantitative genetic analysis of omic data. I wish I had more time to mingle with the Animal Breeding and Genetics group. My tight schedule did not allow enough time following the talk; however, overall I had a pleasant and productive time in Ames.

I have been learning a lot about funding opportunities and grantmanship along the way.
I am pleased to announce that my Layman proposal has been funded from the Layman Fund held at the University of Nebraska Foundation.
A one-month long effort on writing the internal grant proposal has converged to my first funding stream. 
The process of writing the grant proposal reminded me of the struggle I had with composing a non-research paper [a few months ago](http://morotalab.org/monthlyReports/reports/2014/11/30/November-2014-Monthly-Report/). 
Without helpful support from my colleagues, I would not be able to share the good news on this monthly report. The project start date is June 1, 2015 and it continues until May 31, 2016.
I intend to use this funding as a stepping stone to secure external fundings.

I am at the point in the writing of a [guide](http://morotalab.org/literature/) to quantitative genetics papers. I have jotted down a few things regarding the [The Origin of BLUP and MME](http://morotalab.org/literature/2015/03/07/The-Origin-of-BLUP-and-MME/) during the spring break. Stay tuned for more posts. 

Lastly, I had my first faculty annual evaluation meeting with our department chair. This evaluation was based on my performance between August and December 2014.
This was a great opportunity for me to ask a couple of questions that I had in mind. 
The chair kindly expressed his willingness to support me in a wide range of issues.
