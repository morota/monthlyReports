As of March 2015, I am a halfway through my first year since I started my first job at UNL.
This month opened with a trip to Iowa State University in Ames.
I gave an invited seminar entitled "Quantitative Genetics in the Functional Genomics era" covering topics ranging from functional characterization of whole-genome regression to MeSH enrichment analysis.
The main thrust of my talk was to emphasize that this is an exciting moment to conduct quantitative genetic analysis of omic data. My tight schedule did not allow enough time for me to mingle with the Animal Breeding and Genetics group following my talk, but I had a pleasant time in Ames. 

I have been learning a lot about funding opportunities and grantmanship along the way.
I am pleased to announce that my Layman proposal has been funded from the Layman Fund held at the University of Nebraska Foundation.
A one-month long effort of writing an internal grant proposal has converged to my first funding stream. 
The process of writing a grant proposal reminded me of the struggle I had with writing a non-research paper [back then](http://morotalab.org/monthlyReports/reports/2014/11/30/November-2014-Monthly-Report/). 
Without helpful supports from my colleagues, I would not be able to share the good news on this monthly report. The project start date is June 1, 2015 and it continues until May 31, 2016.
I intend to use this funding as a stepping stone to secure external fundings.

I am at the point in the writing of a [guide](http://morotalab.org/literature/) to quantitative genetics papers. I have jotted down a few things regarding the [The Origin of BLUP and MME](http://morotalab.org/literature/2015/03/07/The-Origin-of-BLUP-and-MME/) during the spring break. Stay tuned for more posts. 

Lastly, I had my first faculty annual evaluation meeting with our department chair. This evaluation was based on my performance between August and December 2014.
This was a great opportunity for me to ask a couple of questions that I had in mind, and the chair kindly expressed his willingness to support me in a wide range of issues.
